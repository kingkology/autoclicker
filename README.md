# autoclicker
This Chrome extension will allow you to dynamically specify the click timing and button class using a popup interface, and it will handle the background task of auto-clicking the button on the webpage as well as scrolling the page randomly. You can combine this with mouse jiggler (found in folder) to simulate mouse movements, mouse scrolls and mouse clicks. 
Please remember to use this extension responsibly and only on websites where automation is allowed.
